<h1>Ransom attack </h1>
<h3 class="rat">Danger attack and instant damage your system </h3>
<p>   Ransomware is a type of malware attack in which the attacker locks and encrypts the victim’s data, important files and then demands a payment to unlock and decrypt the data.

    This type of attack takes advantage of human, system, network, and software vulnerabilities to infect the victim’s device—which can be a computer, printer, smartphone, wearable, point-of-sale (POS) terminal, or other endpoint.   </p>

<h1>Rat attack</h1>
<h3 class="rat">Rat  control your system slowly </h3>
<p>  Remote access is a common tool of any IT professionals. If you ever had your computer fixed, you probably had a technician access your machine from a remote location. They can take control of your PC using software created for this specific function.

    Having remote access to any machine is a hacker’s dream. The ability to monitor and gather information from anyone without their knowledge certainly opens them for identity theft, bank account infiltration, and more. Unfortunately, this is very possible using a RAT  </p>
